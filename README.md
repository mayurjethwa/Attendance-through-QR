# :bookmark_tabs: Attendance through QR
  
## :thinking: Problem Statement:

"Attendance through QR" manages and keeps track of students
attendance. This management system consists of a website and an
application. The website generates the QR code, which is scanned by the
app to record the student attendance. The teachers will receive unique
login information that may be used to create the QR code as well as to
monitor and review student attendance. Teachers can utilize the website
to view specific student information and attendance records. The website
displays a pie chart with student attendance data for the teachers and
Faculty. If a particular student's attendance rate falls below 75%, the
application will send out an alert message.

## :open_book: Project Description:
Whether a person is a student in school, an university student, or even an office worker, they must mark their attendance every day. Although it may not seem like it, doing so consumes a significant amount of time that could be used far more effectively. And in order to address this problem, a number of technologies, including RFID, NFC, biometric sensors (including retina scanners and fingerprint readers), and QR-based attendance systems, were introduced to the market to speed up the somewhat sluggish process of attendance marking. 
Due to the large number of students present and the possibility of malpractice, attendance marking in institutions like colleges is a very time-consuming process for both students and professors (attendance proxy). However, with a QR-based attendance management system, the instructor must create a QR code for the specific lecture they are teaching, and the students must scan this code to indicate their attendance. This information is then recorded in the database, and the instructor can review and download the attendance data from the website.

## :dart: Aim & Objective:
* The Attendance Through QR project aims to provide an efficient and convenient way for teachers to take attendance of their students using QR codes. 
* The objective is to create a web application that generates unique QR codes for each student in a class, which can be scanned by a mobile application to submit the attendance data to the web application. 
* The project aims to reduce paper-based attendance sheets, make the process faster and more accurate, and generate attendance reports for monitoring student attendance patterns.
* A precise reports dependent on the student attendance is produced here.
